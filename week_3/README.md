# Blinky

The assignment this week was to make a LED blink and a button push noticeable.

At first I tried my luck on the [STM32L152 Discovery Board](https://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/32l152cdiscovery.html) using all the comfort of the STM32Cube IDE and the full HAL.
After that, I tried to implement the task on the [Adafruit Trinket M0](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3500) with less tools.
